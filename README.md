# Bonsai - Growing small music communities together

Welcome to the Bonsai source.
Bonsai is a platofrm that allows music-heads to come together and share, discover and enjoy music together. 
We are an open sourced platform with distributed designs to increase stability and customization options.

## Features / Todo List

####Rooms
- [Bonsai will support multiple rooms](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/5)
- [Each room will have syncronized chat](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/7)
- [Users can talk in any number of rooms at once, even if they are not synced to that room. Synced means listening to the music of that room](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/11)
- A staff list of infinate size can be set up by the room owner.
- [A permission schema can be selected by the room owner](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/8)
- [Set and forget mode to play music to your listeners even when you're not online](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/21)

####Users
- [status of each user can be seen by everyone else.](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/30)
- [users can change their display names, but not their slug/username.](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/12)

####DJs
- [Any synced user of that room can vote on the current DJs plays, with leafs and sparks](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/10)

####Solo-Play
- [Users do not need to be in a community in order to listen to their playlists](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/9)
- If a user hits pause when sycned to a room, it will remove their sync status and move them to a solo-play session. They can continue chatting in an unsynced room.

####Synced-Play
- [Rooms will allow a rotating dj play music for the sycned listeners of a room](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/6)

- [On first play/add to playlist a link is stored in the Bonsai Lirbary](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/17)
- [Users can tag genres to existing library items to allow for discovery of similar music](https://github.com/WritheM/bonsai/issues/15)

####API and Channels other than Web
